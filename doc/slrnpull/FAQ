1.  Why can't I post when using slrnpull?

   In order to post an article via slrnpull, slrn needs to place the
   article in the slrnpull out.going directory.  Two things are
   necessary for this to happen:
   
       a.  slrn must know that you are using the slrnpull out.going
           directory for posts.  Make sure the line 
	     
	       set use_slrnpull 1

           is in your .slrnrc file.  This indicates to slrn that the
	   news spool is an slrnpull news spool.
	   
       b.  You must have write permission to the out.going directory
           in order for slrn to place your article in that directory.
	   The permissions may be changed via the Unix command:
	   
	       chmod ugo+rwxt out.going
	       
	   Do not put this in your .slrnrc file!

2.  How do I get a full list of newsgroups?
   
   You will have to go online for that.  Run slrn as follows:
   
     slrn --nntp -h YOUR.NEWS.SERVER -a -f groups.dat --create
     
   This will start slrn and down-load the groups and put them in the
   file groups.dat.  Before actually doing this, modify your .slrnrc
   (or slrn.rc) file to set
   
         set write_newsrc_flags 0
	 
   so that all groups will be written out to groups.dat.
